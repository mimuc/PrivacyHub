# Tangible SmartHome Dashboard
This repository contains the code as well as all resources for my masters-thesis regarding a tangible SmartHome Dashboard.
In this file, the general general file-structure is explained, but user-guides for each part of the project will be included in separate README files in each of the sub-folders.

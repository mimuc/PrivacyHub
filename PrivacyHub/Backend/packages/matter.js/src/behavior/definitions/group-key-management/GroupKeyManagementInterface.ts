 * Effect on Receipt
 *
 * If the EpochKey0 field is null or its associated EpochStartTime0 field is null, then this command shall fail with an
 * INVALID_COMMAND status code sent back to the initiator.
 *
 * If the EpochKey1 field is not null, its associated EpochStartTime1 field shall contain a later epoch start time than
 * the epoch start time found in the EpochStartTime0 field. Otherwise this command shall fail with an INVALID_COMMAND
 * status code sent back to the initiator.
 *
 * If the EpochKey2 field is not null, then the EpochKey1 field shall NOT be null. Otherwise this command shall fail
 * with an INVALID_COMMAND status code sent back to the initiator.
 *
 * If the EpochKey2 field is not null, its associated EpochStartTime2 field shall contain a later epoch start time than
 * the epoch start time found in the EpochStartTime1 field. Otherwise this command shall fail with an INVALID_COMMAND
 * status code sent back to the initiator.
 *
 * If there exists a Group Key Set associated with the accessing fabric which has the same GroupKeySetID as that
 * provided in the GroupKeySet field, then the contents of that group key set shall be replaced. A replacement shall be
 * done by executing the equivalent of entirely removing the previous Group Key Set with the given GroupKeySetID,
 * followed by an addition of a Group Key Set with the provided configuration. Otherwise, if the GroupKeySetID did not
 * match an existing entry, a new Group Key Set associated with the accessing fabric shall be created with the provided
 * data. The Group Key Set shall be written to non-volatile storage.
 *
 * Upon completion, this command shall send a status code back to the initiator:
 *
 *   • If the Group Key Set was properly installed or updated on the Node, the status code shall be set to SUCCESS.
 *
 *   • If there are insufficient resources on the receiver to store an additional Group Key Set, the status code shall
 *     be set to RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED (see group key limits);
 *
 *   • Otherwise, this status code shall be set to FAILURE.

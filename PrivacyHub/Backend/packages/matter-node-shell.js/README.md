# matter.js Node Shell

STATUS: Work In Progress (WIP)

This project provides a light-weight node.js implementation of a Matter shell application like the chip-tool from the official Matter-SDK.

## Install

If you want to install just the shell app then you can do so by running:

```
npm install @project-chip/matter-node-shell.js
```

## Run

There are three ways to start matter-node-shell. The `nodenum` parameter provides a unique identifier for the matter-node-shell process mainly to allocate a unique port number. If `nodenum` is not passed, it will default to `0`.
The shell currently just supports Controller side and so the port is not used and the node is always by default a "controller".

```
npm shell <nodenum>
```

There are other parameters available to enable BLE and define the HCI device to use. See `npm shell -- --help` for more details.

## General usage

The shell offers and interactive prompt that can execute commands. If you just enter the command name that has sub commands (with or without followed by "help"), it will display the command options. If you enter the command name followed by the options, it will execute the command, with "help" after the command name it will show the detailed help for this command.

e.g. `commission` or `commission help` will display the commissioning command options

### help

Display a list of all top-level commands supported and a brief description.

```
matter-node> help
  commission                               Handle device commissioning
  config                                   Manage global configuration
  session                                  Manage session
  nodes                                    Manage nodes
  subscribe [node-id]                      Subscribe to all events and attributes of a node
  identify [time] [node-id] [endpoint-id]  Trigger Identify command with given time (default 10s). Execute on one node or endpoint, else all onoff clusters will be controlled
  discover                                 Handle device discovery
  attributes                               Read and Write attributes
  events                                   Read events
  commands                                 Invoke commands
  exit                                     Exit
```

### Help for commands

For every command help can be requested by using the command name, or by adding with `--help` as parameter to any command text.

For instance `config --help` will display all node configuration for the persistent store of the shell.

```
> config
  config loglevel             Manage Console and File LogLevels
  config logfile              Manage Logfile path
  config ble-hci              Manage BLE HCI ID (Linux)
  config wifi-credentials     Manage Wi-Fi credentials used in commissioning process
  config thread-credentials   Manage Thread credentials used in commissioning process

Done
```

### Logging

By default the Shell logs messages to the console. The log level can be changed using the `config loglevel` command. The log level can be set to `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug` or `trace`. The console default is "info".

Additionally the Shell can log to a file. The log file path can be set using the `config logfile` command or as commandline parameter (which will then be persisted in the configuration). The log file always contain the logs in "debug" level.

### Commission a device

The shell supports discovery and also commissioning of devices. The commissioning process is based on the Matter SDK and uses the same commissioning process as the chip-tool. The commissioning process is started by the `commission pair` command.

In order to pair a device you need to specify the pairing-code which is printed on the device QR-Code as parameter pairing-code: `commission pair --pairing-code 123456789`. This is the easiest way for all production devices.
For development devices that use the matter standard discriminator and pin code the parameter con be omitted or more details can be provided as parameters (see `commission pair --help` for more details).

If the device should be commissioned via BLE because it is not yet in the IP network you can add the `--ble` parameter. This will start the BLE advertisement and the device can be paired via BLE. BLE is only available when the shell was started with the `--ble` parameter!
When commissioning a device via BLE you also need to setup wifi or thread credentials (based on the device type) that are then used in the commissioning process. This can be done using the `config wifi-credentials` or `config thread-credentials` commands.
IMPORTANT: These credentials are stored unencrypted in the filesystem!

You can also define the node id to pair the device by providing this ID as parameter `commission pair 5000`.

You can commission multiple nodes to the controller.

After a successfull commissioning the shell outputs the device name and some information and automatically described to the node and logs potential updates.

### List commissioned nodes

The list of nodes can be listed using `nodes list` command. This will list all nodes that are currently commissioned to the controller and provides some information stored in the controller like name, node-id and a copy of the Basic Information cluster details and latest MDNS discovery data.

### Connect to a node

When fresh starting the shell it do not connect to the commissioned nodes automatically.

Using `nodes connect` the shell tries to connect to all commissioned nodes. Alternatively you can provide a node-id to connect to a specific node (`nodes connect 5000`).

Additional parameters to the connect command are the subscription delays (min/max). So if you want to make sure you get data subscribed use `nodes connect 5000 <min> <max>` with values in seconds.

### Log a Node structure

To see the full node structure of a node you can use the `nodes log` command and provide the node-id as parameter (`nodes log 5000`).

### Commissioning related node operations

To open a commissioning window on a node to allow an additional pairing use `commission open-enhanced-window <node-id>`. When the command was successful the shell outputs the pairing code and a QR code to scan with the relevant pairing App.

To unpair a node use `commission unpair <node-id>`. This will remove the node from the controller and also remove the node from the persistent storage.

### Interact with the node using Attributes, Events and Commands

The shell supports reading and writing attributes (top level command `attributes` or `a` as alias), reading events (`events`/`e`) and invoking commands (`commands`/`c`) on the node. Below these top level commands the full list of the officially defined clusters is available to be used. See the help for the relevant cluster for more details.

For reading attributes also a bulk read for all attributes is supported and with the `by-id` variant you can read and attribute from any cluster including custom clusters.

Writing attributes and executing commands (when the request requires data) these can be provided as JSON when it is no simple type. The shell will try to parse the JSON and send the data to the node. Binary data and Numbers >56bit needs to be provided as strings in this JSON and are automatically converted.
For convenience reasons any number in the value to write or invoke data can be provided as hex string by prefixing it with `0x` (e.g. `"0x1234"`) and is then also converted automatically.
When sending complex JSON content ideally use single quotes around the json because double quotes are used to define the JSON content.

Some examples:

-   `attributes basicinformation read all 5000 0` reads all attributes from the Basic Information cluster from node 5000 endpoint 0
-   `attributes basicinformation read nodelabel 5000 0` reads the attribute "nodelabel" from the Basic Information cluster from node 5000 endpoint 0
-   `attributes basicinformation read 0x5 5000 0` reads the attribute "nodelabel" (aliased with it's hex attribute id) from the Basic Information cluster from node 5000 endpoint 0
-   `attributes by-id 0x28 read 0x5 5000 0` also reads the attribute "nodelabel" from the Basic Information cluster from node 5000 endpoint 0, but as generic read from the cluster with id 0x28 (also the decimal value 40 can be used)
-   `attributes basicinformation write nodelabel "My Node" 5000 0` writes the value "My Node" to the attribute "nodelabel" from the Basic Information cluster from node 5000 endpoint 0. Instead of nodelabel also 0x5 as alias can be used.
-   `attributes binding write binding '[{"node": "4568118954124746267" , "cluster": 6 , "endpoint": 1 }]' 5000 1` writes the binding array to the Binding cluster from node 5000 endpoint 1 to create a binding for node 4568118954124746267 to cluster 6 on endpoint 1. Note that the 64bit Node-id (4568118954124746267) needs to be provided as string because it is too big for a number.
-   `attributes binding write binding '[{"node": "4568118954124746267" , "cluster": "0x6" , "endpoint": 1 }]' 5000 1` writes the same binding array as abobe but uses a hex string for the cluster id in the json data
-   `events basicinformation startup 5000 0` reads the details from the startup event from the Basic Information cluster from node 5000 endpoint 0
-   `commands onoff toggle 5000 1` executes the "toggle" command on the OnOff cluster from node 5000 endpoint 1
-   `commands onoff offwitheffect '{"effectIdentifier":0,"effectVariant":0}' 5000 1` executes the "offwitheffect" command on the OnOff cluster from node 5000 endpoint 1 with the given JSON data

### exit

Exit the shell terminal.

```
> exit
Goodbye
```

# Running multiple instances

The matter shell app uses the `node-localstorage` package to persistently store configuration data of each node on disk. In order to run multiple nodes on one machine, start each node with their own `nodenum` so each will create and use their own `.matter-shell-#` directory and use different ports for communication where `#` is the `nodenum` passed from the commandline.

```
# From matter-node-shell top-level
npm shell 1

# In different terminal
npm shell 2
```

To delete node state, i.e. factory reset, just delete the `.matter-shell-#` directory of the node:

```
rm -fr .matter-shell-2
```

The contents of the `.matter-shell-#` directory are human-readable, where each field in the key/value store is a separate file in ascii format:

```
$ ls .matter-shell-1
0.MatterController.fabric			0.SessionManager.resumptionRecords
0.MatterController.fabricCommissioned		Node.discriminator
0.MatterController.operationalIpServerAddress	Node.ip
0.RootCertificateManager.nextCertificateId	Node.longDiscriminator
0.RootCertificateManager.rootCertBytes		Node.pin
0.RootCertificateManager.rootCertId		Node.port
0.RootCertificateManager.rootKeyIdentifier	Node.shortDiscriminator
0.RootCertificateManager.rootKeyPair

$ more .matter-shell-1/Node.ip
"fe80::148d:9bd8:5006:243%en0"
```

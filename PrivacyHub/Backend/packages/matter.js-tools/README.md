# Matter.js Tooling

This package supports build, test and execution infrastructure for other
`@project-chip/matter.js` packages.

## Rational

Matter.js consists of a large number of generated TypeScript files.  We support
multiple module formats targeting disparate JavaScript runtimes including Node
and web browsers.  We publish a moderate (and growing) number of packages to
NPM.  We support Linux, Windows and Mac OS.

Previously, TSC analysis and test times had become quite slow.  A proliferation
of configuration files for TSC and test framework was adding significant
redundancy to the codebase.

This package standardizes and centralizes configuration for build and test.  It
minimizes reliance on TSC and generally does its best to run build and test as
quickly as possible.

## Dev workflow

Although Matter.js relies on third party tools for build and test, the
interface is command-line oriented and unique to Matter.js.  As such it will be
unfamiliar to new developers.

To minimize developer burden, we also maintain traditional `tsconfig.json`
files with project references in each `src/` and `test/`.  These files support
traditional IDE and `tsc --watch` workflows and are largely (but not entirely)
ignored by the tooling package.

These files do add configuration overhead but we minimize this with a shared
[tsconfig.base.json](tsconfig.base.json) supplied by this package.

We also supply a standard `.mocharc.cjs` in packages with tests.  You can use
this with your IDE's Mocha integration for standard testing workflows.

## Build

We use [TSC](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html)
to validate TypeScript types and generate declaration files.  We
use [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for transcoding TypeScript to ESM
(ES6 module format) and CJS (CommonJS module format).

The [matter-build](./bin/build.js) script orchestrates TSC and esbuild.  It
inspects `package.json` for the target module to determine whether to emit
ESM, CJS or both.

Use `matter-build --help` for command line usage.  `matter-build --workspaces`
builds all workspace packages that have changed (or depend on other workspace
packages that have changed) since the last build.

`matter-build` itself is implemented in TypeScript.  It uses `esbuild` to
bootstrap itself in fresh installs.

## Test

We run tests using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) with
[chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) for assertions.  For multi-format modules we
run tests as both CJS and ESM.  For packages that support browsers we run tests
in a headless browser using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

The [matter-test](./bin/test.js) scripts orchestrates test execution.  Use
`matter-test --help` for command line usage.

By default matter-test inspects `package.json` for the target module to
determine whether to test ESM, CJS or both under Node.  Web tests do not run by
default but you can enable them using the `-w` option.

`matter-test` supports
environment variables of the form `MATTER_<OPTION>` for most command line
arguments.  This includes `MATTER_SPEC`, `MATTER_PROFILE`, `MATTER_GREP`,
`MATTER_FGREP`, `MATTER_INVERT` and `MATTER_ALL_LOGS`.

Matter.js emits a significant volume of logging during testing.  By default,
`matter-test` captures these logs internally and only emits them when
reporting on failed tests.

The test environment orchestrated by this package installs a small number of
Mocks for Matter.js infrastructure singletons.
[global-declarations.ts](src/testing/global-declarations.ts) defines a global
API for these mocks.

## Execution

The final command supplied by the tooling package is [matter-run](bin/run.js).
This command bootstraps tooling, transpiles the target module, and executes
the named JS or TS script.

`matter-run` understands Matter.js `package.json` conventions and
automatically transpiles typescript files in the target package prior to
execution.

`matter-run` accepts a script to run and passes other arguments to the script
verbatim.

If you set the environment variable `MATTER_ECHO`, `matter-run` will print the
command line prior to invoking a script.

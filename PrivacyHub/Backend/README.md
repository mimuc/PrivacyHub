# PrivacyHub Backend

Welcome to the backend repository for PrivacyHub, a smart home control hub designed to enhance user privacy. This is a fork of the matter.js implementation of the matter standard. The original README can be found below.
The code for the PrivacyHub backend is located in '*packages/privacyhub*'

## Overview
The backend of PrivacyHub is built with Node.js and uses the Express framework. It handles device commissioning, control, and privacy management, providing APIs for the frontend to interact with. The backend also integrates with commercial smart home devices using the Matter standard, enabling seamless control and privacy management.

## Key Features
- Device Commissioning: Add new smart devices to the network using Bluetooth and Thread.
- Privacy States Management: Control device access with three privacy statesâ€”Local, Online, and Online-Shared.
- Data Persistence: Store device states and historical data using MongoDB.
- Integration with Third-Party Hubs: Support for pairing devices with third-party hubs like Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit.

## Installing dependencies

Refer to the matter.js guides below

## Running the application

Navigate to '*packages/privacyhub*' and execute the following command (try with sudo if it does not work):
`npm run privacyhub-app`

## Privacy States
- **Local**: Device accessible only within the local network.
- **Online**: Device accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.
- **Online-Shared**: Device can be paired with third-party hubs (e.g., Amazon Alexa).

## Data Management
The backend uses MongoDB to store persistent data, including device states and historical interaction logs.


# JavaScript/TypeScript based Matter Implementation

## What is Matter?

[Matter](https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/matter/) is a new secure, reliable and local standard protocol for smart/IoT devices launched at the end of 2022 by the [Connectivity Standards Alliance](https://csa-iot.org/). 

To learn more about Matter visit [https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/matter/](https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/matter/)

## What is matter.js?

matter.js is a TypeScript/JavaScript implementation of the complete Matter protocol.

Our main goal is to create a robust and compliant library that enables the seamless implementation of Matter-compatible devices, bridges, controllers, and a shell application. This effort is dedicated to improving Matter's accessibility for testers, smart home enthusiasts, and developers of OS-based IoT products. Fostering a second implementation of the Matter standard, aligned with the same specifications, not only expands the ecosystem but also contributes to the validation and increased robustness of the standard itself.

matter.js consists of a [pure JavaScript base package](./packages/matter.js) without any native dependencies, implementing the Matter protocol and required interfaces in JavaScript, along with extensive typings for The Matter standard and the matter.js APIs.
Further [packages with Node.js based native dependencies](./packages/matter-node.js) utilize the base package to implement platform-specific parts using Node.js for networking and other necessary native features or add [BLE support](./packages/matter-node-ble.js). [Node.js example scripts](./packages/matter-node.js-examples) implement example CLI scripts for Devices, Bridges or Controllers. A [Matter Shell](./packages/matter-node-shell.js) allow to interact with Matter devices as controller via a CLI interface.

To use matter.js in your own Non-Node.js based projects you need to implement the platform specific parts. See [How to use matter.js in own projects](#how-to-use-matterjs-in-own-projects) for more details. If you do this please contact us to add your platform to the list of supported platforms.

matter.js employs [code generation approaches](./codegen) to ensure a comprehensive model of all Matter Clusters and (soon) device types. This includes typing and documentation, readily available within developers' IDEs, facilitating easy accessibility and adherence to conformance information during coding. This approach allows for easy addition of new clusters and device types, ensuring synchronization with the Matter standard.

## What matter.js can be used for?

matter.js serves various purposes and can be employed for:

- **Developing Production-Ready Matter Devices or Bridges:**<br>Use JavaScript/TypeScript to create Matter devices or bridges for OS-based IoT products. The extensive typing information and documentation facilitate the easy implementation of required functionality while ensuring synchronization with the Matter specification.

- **Developing Matter Controllers:**<br>Develop Matter controllers with JavaScript/TypeScript for OS-based IoT products. Post-commissioning (including BLE support), controllers can access all data from devices and control them. The API supports development with known typings of all clusters when endpoints and device types are known during development. It also allows generic programmatic access to all clusters and attributes. Typing information of custom clusters can be added to the controller or accessed generically with generic data parsing support.

- **Rapid Prototyping for Testing and Development:**<br>Enable rapid development of device or controller prototypes for testing and development purposes. JavaScript's nature and the convenient matter.js API make it easy to create prototypes. Testing different feature combinations or endpoint structures can be done quickly using JavaScript testing frameworks.

- **Developing Bridges Between Matter and Other Ecosystems:**<br>Implement bridges between Matter and other ecosystems using JavaScript. Utilize the many available JavaScript libraries to easily bridge between ecosystems.

- **Using the Matter Shell Application as a Controller:**<br>Employ the Matter Shell application as a controller to interact with Matter devices via a CLI interface. Ideal for manual testing and development purposes.

- **Home Assistant - Matter integration**: Fully working

We also collected a [list of tested device types on ecosystem](#device-types-tested-on-various-ecosystems).This is a compilation of published information by the ecosystems and own community tests.

Each ecosystem have their own specialities, see [Pairing and Usage Information](#pairing-and-usage-information) for more details.

A list ok known issues with some ecosystems can be found in [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md).

matter.js/matter-node.js as Controller was successfully tested with Chip example apps and several production devices (see [here](https://github.com/project-chip/matter.js/discussions/316) ).

Please report any outdated or newly discovered information on compatible ecosystems, devices, and device types or issues.

## Monorepo Code structure Overview

This repository contains multiple packages (and because of this it is a monorepo). The packages are contained in the `packages` directory and are all published separately to NPM.

- **[matter.js](./packages/matter.js)**: the core Matter implementation in typescript which is JavaScript only and has no native dependencies. It is build and published as CommonJS and ES6 variants in one package.
- **[matter-node.js](./packages/matter-node.js)**: a node.js implementation of a Matter DeviceNode and ControllerNode which also re-exports all matter.js exports and so can be used as only dependency. It is build and published as CommonJS and ES6 variants in one package.
- **[matter-node-ble.js](./packages/matter-node-ble.js)**: a node.js based implementation of BLE features for matter-node.js to allow commissioning via BLE (Device and Controller). It is build and published as CommonJS and ES6 variants in one package.
- **[matter-node-shell.js](./packages/matter-node-shell.js)**: a node.js based Matter Shell script to allow to interact with Matter devices as controllers via a CLI interface
- **[matter-node.js-examples](./packages/matter-node.js-examples)**: Reference implementations of Matter devices and controller as CLI scripts using matter-node.js and matter-node-ble.js
- **[matter.js-tools](./packages/matter.js-tools)**: Tools used internally to build, test and run the project which incorporates on-the-fly Typescript building. You most likely do not need these tools for your projects but are free to use them.

For each package the [API Documentation](./docs/README.md) is updated on each official release, but can also be built locally using `npm run build-doc`.

Beside these packages that are published to npm there are also some packages that are not published to npm and exist as folders in the root directory:
- **[chip-testing](./chip-testing)**: A set of scripts to allow to run the Chip-Tool-Certification tests against a matter-node.js based devices. These tests are executed on GitHub CI automatically.
- **[codegen](./codegen)**: A set of scripts to generate code for the Matter code model, clusters and device types.
- **[model](./models)**: Contains all pre-parsed information for the Matter models used to generate code for the code model, clusters and device types. It also allows to define [local overrides](./models/src/local) to adjust incomplete or wrong information in the Matter models.

This repository uses the workspaces feature from npm to manage the dependencies between the packages. Because of this please only use `npm install` on the root of the repository. This will install all the dependencies for all the packages and also take care to create relevant symlinks between the packages.

Additionally, it uses typescript project references to allow IDE support for the dependencies. These dependencies need to be added to the tsconfig.json files if needed.

You can build and test the packages separately or all by using `npm run build` or `npm run test` on root package level. With `npm run build-clean` you can build all packages from scratch.

## Release tags

To allow a simple use of the matter.js Monorepo based project in other projects, we publish all packages separately to NPM. There are two available release tags on NPM:

- **latest**: This is the default NPM tag and contains official released versions of the packages. This is the recommended tag to use in your projects. Whenever we build a new official release also the docs are updated and available in the repository.
- **dev**: This tag contains a nightly build of the project and is updated every night if there were changes in the repository. This is only for testing and development purposes and should not be used for real production use cases. Use e.g. `npm install @project-chip/matter-node.js@dev` to install the latest nightly build of matter-node.js.

## Community communication

If you have issues please use the GitHub "[Issues](https://github.com/project-chip/matter.js/issues)" of this repository. For questions or idea discussions please use the "[Discussions](https://github.com/project-chip/matter.js/discussions)" in this GitHub repository.

Additionally, we started a Discord server for Matter-Integrators to allow to communicate about the protocol and how to implement Matter in various environments (not only just JavaScript/Typescript). You can join it here: https://discord.gg/ujmRNrhDuW .

## How to use matter.js

### To develop matter.js

If you like to develop matter.js itself or want to contribute to it, you can use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/project-chip/matter.js
cd matter.js
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies and create symlinks between the packages, so that it can be used locally. It also builds all packages.

On Windows in order to successfully build all the packages (tested on Windows 11 Pro) make sure that to have installed Node.js 16+, the windows-build-tools and node-gyp version 10.
On Non-Windows platforms and having Python 3.12+ installed please also make sure to use npm 10.2.3+.

### To use matter(-node).js in own projects

To use matter.js in own projects you simply use matter-node.js as dependency in your project. This package also re-exports all interfaces from matter.js, so it is not needed to use matter.js directly. If you need BLE support you can use matter-node-ble.js as additional dependency.

```bash
npm install @project-chip/matter-node.js --save
```

If your project is not based on Node.js you need to implement the platform specific parts. See [How to use matter.js in own projects](#how-to-use-matterjs-in-own-projects) for more details.

### To try out the Node.js based Examples

if you just want to try out the Node.js based examples you can use the following commands:

```bash
npm install @project-chip/matter-node.js-examples
```

Please refer to the Examples Readme on how to use the examples: [matter-node.js-examples](packages/matter-node.js-examples/README.md)

## Code style

matter.js relies very much on TypeScript and tries to be as type safe as possible. Please prevent using ts-ignore or other "hacks" as best as possible and try to find and fix the real typing issue if you encounter cases where you need to use them. YOu can also alwayys join discord or as in GitHub discussions if you need help.

The project contains eslint as linter and prettier as formatter. The configuration files are located in the root directory and are valid for all packages.

The following commands are available:

- `npm run lint`: runs eslint on all packages and outputs the results and errors
- `npm run lint-fix`: runs eslint on all packages and tries to fix the errors
- `npm run format`: runs typescript-formatter on all packages and formats the code. Files will be changed in place.
- `npm run format-verify`: runs typescript-formatter on all packages and checks if the code is formatted correctly. If not it will output the files that need to be formatted.

If you want to contribute to the project please make sure to check linting and formatting before creating a PR. The GitHub CI also verifies this and will fail if the code is not formatted correctly.

## Building

You can use `npm run build` on the root level to build all packages in an incremental way. This will only build the changed files.

You can use `npm run build-clean` on the root level to build all packages from scratch.

## Tests

You can use `npm run test` on the root level to run all tests for all packages.

Special testing using the Chip-Tool-Certification tests is available in the package matter-node.js-examples. Please refer to the [README.md](packages/matter-node.js/README.md#chip-tool-certification-testing) in the package for more details.

## API documentation

You can use `npm run build-doc` on the root level to generate the API documentation for all packages in directory doc.

## Current status

We are about to complete the basic certifiable feature set. Right now in the low level APIs all clusters are supported and all kind of devices can be built, but not with pre-defined cluster logic.
See the [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/project-chip/projects/11/views/1) for status and next planned steps.

## How to use matter.js in own projects

matter.js itself can not be used directly in a project because some platform specific functionalities needs to be added. These are:

- **BigInt/UInt8Array**: Right now matter.js relies on certain ES6 JavaScript language features like BigInt and UInt8Array. If your platform does not support this you need to add a polyfill for this.
- **Network**: The Network implementation needs to provide UDP server and client functionality. This is a core requirement. The [Network Interface](packages/matter.js/src/net/Network.ts) needs to be implemented which includes methods to query network interfaces of the system and to use UDP sockets.
- **Crypto**: Until we have a pure JavaScript implementation of the required crypto functions, a native implementation is needed. The [Crypto Interface](packages/matter.js/src/crypto/Crypto.ts) needs to be implemented which includes methods to generate random numbers, generate keys and to encrypt/decrypt data with various algorithms.
- **Storage**: The Storage implementation needs to provide a way to store and retrieve data, easiest in a key-value form. The [Storage Interface](packages/matter.js/src/storage/Storage.ts) needs to be implemented which includes methods to store and retrieve data.
- **Time**: The Time implementation needs to provide a way to get the current time in milliseconds, but mainly need to offer Timer functionalities (Interval and Singe timers). The [Time Interface](packages/matter.js/src/time/Time.ts) needs to be implemented which includes methods to get the current time in milliseconds. 
- **BLE**: If your implementation is not Ethernet based or Pre-Connected to an IP network you need to provide a BLE implementation. The [BLE Interface](packages/matter.js/src/ble/Ble.ts) needs to be implemented which includes methods to start and stop BLE advertising and to connect to a BLE device. Depending on if you implement a Controller or Device you need to implement the Peripheral and Broadcaster (Device) or Central and Scanner (Controller) BLE interfaces. **For a device the platform you implement needs to allow to send custom "Manufacturer data" in the BLE advertising packet!**
- **Wi-Fi/Thread Commissioning**: If you want to implement a Device which is not Ethernet based you need to provide a Wifi or Thread Commissioning implementation. This needs to include methods to scan for networks, configure the device for a network and to connect to a network. The implementation in this case needs to provide the functionality as command handlers for a WifiNetworkCommissioning- or a ThreadNetworkCommissioning-Cluster.

The following reference implementation and code references are available as basis for own platform implementations:

- For Network, Crypto, Storage and Time functionality you can use the Node.js implementations provided by [matter-node.js](packages/matter-node.js/README.md) as reference. 
- For BLE functionality you can use the Node.js implementations provided by [matter-node-ble.js](packages/matter-node-ble.js/README.md) as reference. 
- For Wi-Fi/Thread Commissioning functionality you can use the [Node.js DeviceNode example script](packages/matter-node.js-examples/src/examples/cluster/DummyWifiNetworkCommissioningServerLegacy.ts) which contains a static "testing only" (but API complete for Wifi) reference.

If you implement a specific platform we would be happy about a PR with the code, so that also other community members can benefit from it.

## matter.js based projects

If you use a platform where Node.js 16.x+ is available then you can easily and directly use the following project that base on matter.js

matter.js is used at the core of those two projects currently:

- [matter-node.js](packages/matter-node.js/README.md): a Matter client / server running on node.js compatible with HA (Android / iOs support in progress)
- [matter-node-shell.js](packages/matter-node-shell.js/README.md): a Matter Shell script to allow to interact with Matter devices as controllers via a CLI interface
- [node-red-matter](https://github.com/FezVrasta/node-red-matter): a Node-Red Node for devices and controllers
- [zigbee-matter-bridge](https://github.com/antonio-gabriele/zigbee-matter-bridge): a Zigbee to Matter Bridge

## Pairing and Usage Information

It should work with any Matter-compatible home automation app when Matter will be released. We tested the Library with a few common ones and can provide additional information.

### Apple

Minimum OS Required for iOS and tvOS devices: iOS 16.2 or later, with latest iOS version recommended.

Apple has two guides that can help you get setup:

- [Set up your HomePod, HomePod mini, Apple TV, or iPad as a home hub](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207057)
- [Pair and manage your Matter accessories](https://support.apple.com/en-asia/102135)

When pairing with matter.js the operating system will ask you to allow to pair an "uncertified device" which you need to allow. After that the device
will be added to the Home app, and you can control it from there.

### Google Home Ecosystem

Minimum Version Required for the "Google Home" appï¼š2.62.1.15 or later.

Also for Google you need to have a Hub device (Android or Google Nest smart speakers/display) out of the [list of supported devices](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/12391458?hl=en) to control your Matter devices.

When pairing with matter.js the operating system will ask you to allow to pair an "uncertified device" which you need to allow. If you want to avoid this message you optionally can register the relevant details for your uncertified devices in your Google Account. For this open the [Google
Developer Console to add an Integration](https://console.home.google.com/projects/) and [setup](https://developers.home.google.com/matter/get-started?hl=en&%3Bauthuser=0&authuser=0) the device there. Please use 0xFFF1 as Vendor ID
because matter.js uses this by the current scripts by default..

If you have issues with pairing please refer to the [Troubleshootling pages](https://developers.home.google.com/matter/build/troubleshooting?hl=en#verify_your_google_play_services_gps_matter_modules) from Google.

Google supports several [Matter device types](https://developers.home.google.com/matter/supported-devices?authuser=0&hl=en) already.

### Amazon Alexa Ecosystem

Minimum Version Required for the "Amazon Alexa" appï¼š2.2.491118.0 or later.

For Amazon Alexa Usage you also need one [Alexa device as Matter hub](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=37490568011) in your local network.

For Alexa no special setup is needed to pair with matter.js as development device.

The [list of supported device types](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smarthome/matter-support.html#device-categories-and-clusters) is basic currently, but will get enhanced in the future.

Alexa currently has a few non-standard requirements:

- Matter devices need to use port 5540 only, else they will not be discovered by Alexa at all
- The device needs to have an Endpoint 1 beside the root endpoint. This needs to either be the main device endpoint 
- composed devices not yet supported
